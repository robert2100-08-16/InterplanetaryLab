## Abstract

This paper presents a robust and scalable conceptual framework for the design, testing, and deployment of modular Standard Space Containers (SSCs) for the storage of methanol and oxygen in their solid (cryogenic “ice”) phases in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The approach leverages a combination of advanced passive thermal protection, redundant active cooling systems, and standardized modular interfaces to address technical challenges, safety concerns, and economic viability over the next 25 years. A detailed background review, technical design rationale, risk assessment, and development roadmap are provided to support the feasibility of this approach in enabling in-orbit refueling, interplanetary mission support, and orbital manufacturing.

## 1. Introduction

The increasing demand for long-duration space operations and interplanetary missions necessitates reliable, safe, and cost-effective storage of key propellants and consumables in orbit. In this context, storing volatile substances like methanol and oxygen as cryogenic “ice” presents an attractive alternative due to potential benefits in density and stability compared to their conventional liquid or gaseous forms. This paper outlines a conceptual design that not only meets these requirements but also incorporates redundancy and scalability through modular SSC designs, supporting applications ranging from satellite refueling to interplanetary “pit stops.”

## 2. Background and Literature Review

Recent advancements in cryogenic storage systems for space applications, including the International Space Station’s cryogenic experiments and in-orbit propellant depots, have demonstrated the technical viability of maintaining extreme temperature environments in space. Prior studies have underscored the importance of passive thermal management and robust material selection. This paper builds upon these findings by addressing the challenges of storing methanol and oxygen in solid form, discussing the phase transition advantages, and providing a detailed review of material and thermal management strategies adopted in similar technologies.
